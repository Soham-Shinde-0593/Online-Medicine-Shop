# Team Plan & Roadmap: Medicine Shop Platform

## Project Goal
Develop a professional-grade online medicine shop. The project is split into two major phases:
1. **Frontend (Now - 6 Months)**: Build a high-fidelity frontend using React/Vite that mimics production behavior using local mocks.
2. **Backend (After 6 Months)**: Migration to a Spring Boot modular monolith backend with PostgreSQL.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Frontend)
- [x] Define `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` (colors, typography, elevations, spacing). *(Completed by Member 1)*
- [x] Frontend architecture setup adhering to Vanilla ES6 Modular structure in `ARCHITECTURE.md`. *(Completed by Member 1)*

### Phase 2: Core Frontend Modules
- **Modular Development**: Each member builds out their assigned feature module (Catalog, Cart, Auth, UI).
  - [x] **Member 1 (Soham Shinde)**: Foundation, Homepage, UI Components, Prescription Upload modal, Toast & Dialog system. *(Completed)*
  - [ ] **Member 2 (Arindam Sarkar)**: Product Catalog, Discovery, Filtering.
  - [ ] **Member 3 (Adithya H K)**: Product Detail, Cart Logic, Persistence.
  - [ ] **Member 4 (Muhammad Abrar Aamir Sheikh)**: Auth Flow, Checkout, Profile.
- **Communication Contract**: All frontend data binding MUST use the interface definitions specified in `docs/API_CONTRACT.md`.

### Phase 3: Mock Integration
- [x] Provide simulated API calls in `frontend/js/api.js` and mock data in `frontend/js/data.js`. *(Completed by Member 1)*
- Replace UI static content with simulated API calls reading from mock contracts.
- This ensures all frontend components are ready to receive live data when the Spring Boot backend arrives.

### Phase 4: Frontend Polish
- Responsiveness, performance optimization, and integration of all modules in a single SPA.

### Phase 5: Future Backend Integration (Milestone: 6 Months)
- Scaffolding Spring Boot modular monolith according to `ARCHITECTURE.md` backend modules.
- Migration of persistence layer from `localStorage` to PostgreSQL.
- Implementation of API endpoints in Spring Boot.
- Connecting frontend `fetch` calls to real Spring Boot API.

## Frontend-Backend Synchronization Strategy
- **Interface Driven Development**: Even while building the frontend, we are writing code *as if* the backend exists.
- **Contract-First**: If any frontend member needs to change how data is perceived, they MUST update `docs/API_CONTRACT.md` before updating the React components. This avoids breaking changes when the backend team starts in 6 months.
